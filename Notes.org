* Configuration Notes

** Connecting to Bluetooth Devices with =bluetoothctl=

If you need to manually connect to Bluetooth audio devices using =bluetoothctl=,
as I currently do in Guix, you'll need to enter these commands at the
=bluetoothctl= prompt:

#+begin_src shell
  system-alias "my-hostname" # To configure your laptop's device name
  default-agent
  power on
  scan on
  # Wait for your device to appear
  pair 04:52:C7:5E:5C:A8
  trust 04:52:C7:5E:5C:A8 # To enable auto-connect
  connect 04:52:C7:5E:5C:A8
#+end_src
