#+TITLE: Personal System Configuration

This repo contains my personal system configuration which enables a consistent
working experience across multiple machines.  These days I primarily use
GNU/Linux via the [[https://guix.gnu.org][Guix System Distribution]].  This makes my configuration highly
replicable and consistent across multiple machines.

I manage the linking of the various configuration files in this repo using [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][GNU
