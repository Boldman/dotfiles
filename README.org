#+TITLE: //home/daviwil//.dotfiles

This repo contains my personal system configuration which enables a consistent
computing experience across multiple machines.  These days I primarily use
GNU/Linux via the [[https://guix.gnu.org][Guix System Distribution]].

I manage the various configuration files in this repo using [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][GNU Stow]].  This
allows me to set up symlinks for all of my dotfiles using a single command:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
stow .
#+END_SRC
